    <p>These images are taken in Hungary, Spain, Greece, Austria, Albania and Egypt. <br>They were taken by Sony a7rii with GM 24-70 lens. <br>"Fun" fact, only seven days after I bought the GM I lens, the GM II came out.

    <p>The fountain was where Sound of the Music shot scenes of Maria taking the kids out. <br>The Seville Cathedral photo was taken in on a Friday afternoon, <br>I learned that Seville people tend to take Thursday and Friday afternoons off. <br>I also had to get up at 3AM and head to the Temple of Abu Simbel, it was in the middle of the dessert.
